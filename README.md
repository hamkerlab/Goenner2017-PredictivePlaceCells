## Dependencies

The code is provided using either the neuro-simulators ANNarchy (<https://annarchy.github.io/>) or brian v1 (<https://briansimulator.org/>). The experiments in the paper were done using Brian, but Brian v1 is only available for Python 2.7, which is now obsolete. The ANNarchy version is a reimplementation and might not be 100% functional.  

### Installing ANNarchy

Using conda for the dependencies, ANNarchy can be installed for Python 3 with:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy matplotlib scipy sympy cython
pip install ANNarchy
```
